## Overview

### Why?

My first coursework from university. Subject - Operation Systems and Shells.

## My process

### Built with

- Java 16;
- Maven;
- JavaFX (don't remember version. The one from 2020, I guess);
- IntelliJ IDEA Community;
- I took CSS somewhere...

### What I learned

- Working with FS in Java;
- Working with system scaning in Java;
- JavaFX as well;
- Semaphores.

### Abilities

- List files in current directory;
- Move between directories;
- Copy, Cut, Delete, Rename (i think) files and folders;
- Go to removable devices;
- Open some programs that are built-in on Windows and Linux with GNOME shell;
- Open another app that scans info 'bout memory, cpu and current time (i believe);
- Second app uses semaphore and works in multithreading mode;

### In plans

I don't want to support this project, tbh. Maybe one day...

### Good to know

In past JavaFX was badly integrated with IDEA. Maybe it's only in Ultimate version, but now you can simply take Maven dependency and everything works just fine.

### Useful resources
